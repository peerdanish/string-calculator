# String Calculator

This is a simple String Calculator project built with React and TypeScript. The calculator accepts a string of numbers separated by delimiters and returns their sum. This project demonstrates the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach and uses Vitest and React Testing Library for testing.

## Features

- **String Calculator Logic**: Handles numbers separated by commas, newlines, or custom delimiters.
- **Error Handling**: Throws errors for negative numbers and invalid input.
- **UI for Calculator**: Users can input a string of numbers and view the result.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Developed using TDD principles with tests written in advance.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and clearer code.
- **Vite**: For bundling and running the development server.
- **Vitest**: For unit testing.
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components.
